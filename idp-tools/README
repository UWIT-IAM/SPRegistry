These are tools run on the IdP hosts to keep metadata and filters up-to-date with
the SP Registry database.  The tools are specific to our IdP configurations, so should be
considered examples -- not directly installable components.


refresh_ic.sh: 

  Maintains a local copy of InCommon metadata

refresh_uw.sh:  

  1) Maintains a local copy of local UW metadata (the SP registry database)
  2) Updates various filter and activator configuration files as needed
  3) Updates the local postgres targeted id database.

spreg_update.py:

  Does (1) for refresh_uw.sh

filter_scan.py:

  Does (2,3) for refresh_uw.sh


The tools need a python virtualenv (I use 2.7), with the requirements in py-requirements.txt


We run the refresh scripts by cron.  refresh_ic daily, refresh_uw every minute.
A second cron, run every 15 minutes forces a refresh_uw run.
