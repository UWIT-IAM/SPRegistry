This the utility that converts the database info into the various xml files on the idp.

This should probably be packaged closer to the idp itself.
Here for now just for safekeeping.


Scan database and update local xml conf as needed

  spreg_update.py

Scan the local xml configs and create auto confs as needed

 filter_scan.py  

creates 

 new tgtid db entries   -> updates tgtid database
 gws activators         -> new gws-activators.xml file
 nameid exceptions      -> new nameid-filter.xml



Also here are a couple of tools for loading the database
from xml files

Load from local xml

  loaddb.sh

Keep the database up-to-date until the database
version goes production

  updatedb.sh
