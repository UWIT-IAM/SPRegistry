Install
--------

1) Be sure there is a spreg.properties.xxx file for the type of host
   you're installing.  xxx = prod | eval | dev

2) Also edit your ansible/local_vars.yml to point to a valid ca and cert/key pair.
   Clear the line with "have_local_certs" if you don't want your cert/key copied
   over to the target.

3) Make the package.  In base product directory:

   $ mvn clean package

4) Run installer.  In this directory:

   $ ./install.sh <host_type>

   host_type = tools_dev | tools_eval | tools_prod
