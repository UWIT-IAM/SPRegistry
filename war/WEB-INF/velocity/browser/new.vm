<h3>Let us retrieve your SP's metadata.</h3>
<p>
If your SP is configured to show its metadata, the default configuration for most Shibboleth installations, we can retrieve most of the information we need.
Enter the DNS name of your Service Provider.

<p>
<input dojoType="dijit.form.TextBox" size="60" id="new_dns" value="" />
<input id="newidButton" type="button" name="lookup" value="Lookup metadata" onClick="lookupSp()" />
<p>
<ul>
<li>You must be the registered owner of the DNS name of your service provider. </li>
<li>Add the port number to the domain if your service uses a nonstandard port, e.g. <tt>example.com:9443</tt></li>
<li>The registry will attempt to retrieve metadata from your SP itself, from the standard metadata endpoint, /Shibboleth.sso/Metadata. Make sure that address is public. There are no private data in your SP's metadata, so there is normally no reason to restrict access to this endpoint. </li>
</ul>
<p>

<h3>Enter your SP's metadata manually</h3>
<p>
If online metadata is not available you may enter it manually.

<input id="manidButton" type="button" name="lookup" value="Do it the hard way" onClick="nolookupSp()" />
